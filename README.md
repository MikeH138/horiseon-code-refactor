# Horiseon Code Refactor
## The Repository
This repository was made for the refactoring of the [Horiseon Social Solution Services website](https://mikeh138.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/) to be more accessible and include semantic html elements.
## Horiseon's Website

The changes I made didn't affect the layout or styling of the website looked at all.  

Rather, what I've done was taken HMTL elements with no meaning, such as div tags, and changed them to semantic HTML5 tags, such as article, aside, footer, nav, and so on.  

Furthermore, I have included alt text for all images on the website, to accommodate for visually impaired users.  

Additionaly, I fixed a broken hyperlink that was meant to take the user to the Search Engine Optimization section of the page.  

As well, I added comments to the stylesheet used for the website, to make it more legible and easier to work with.
