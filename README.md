# Horiseon Code Refactor
## The Repository
This repository was made for the refactoring of the [Horiseon Social Solution Services website](https://mikeh138.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/) to be more accessible and include semantic html elements.
## Horiseon's Website

The changes I made didn't affect the layout or how the website looked at all.

Rather, what I've done was taken html elements with no meaning, such as div tags, and changed them to semantic html tags, such as article, aside, footer, nav, and so on.
